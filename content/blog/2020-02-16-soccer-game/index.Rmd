Today is Sunday 2-16-2020.
 
This morning Alex and I went to a soccer game to cheer up my teammate and experience the true soccer game after weeks of his soccer training from a local soccer training institute-Soccer Shots. 

Unfortunately, I was injured a week before, hitting by a 300-pound guy with full speed on my chest. 
So, I couldn't dress-up and play today. But **our team won 4:1.** in a beautiful way! 
Alex really enjoyed watching the game and played soccer with his Daddy on the sideline.

```

Alex and I had a great time this morning. We kicked soccer ball back and forth. Alex made a couple of good shots. 
I am so proud of him.

Alex really enjoy playing soccer! I wish he improves his skill fast and becomes a good soccer athelete like his daddy.
