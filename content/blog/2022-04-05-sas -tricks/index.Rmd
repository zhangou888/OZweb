# Story

I am not a pure SAS user, but my former jobs (Psychometrics and Assessment) required me to be efficient in SAS. So, I decided beef up my SAS programming skills in the 2017.

## Key Programming Talk


The Key programming thought are included in my 2018 talk


```{r fig2, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.pos='h', fig.cap='Write Readable Codes',echo = FALSE}

    knitr::include_graphics("figure/write-readable-code.jpg", error = FALSE)

```

**Talk Link: ** [Writing readable codes](https://ouzhang.me/slides/readable_code/readable_code.html#1)

Before you continue reading, I suggest you to go over this talk first.

It covers the key thought of the software development and programming.

```{r fig3, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.pos='h', fig.cap='Software development life cycle',echo = FALSE}

    knitr::include_graphics("figure/software development_life_cycle_methodology.png", error = FALSE)

```

Since I move to different industry, I no longer code in SAS very often. Instead, I usually program in R or Python. But a couple of weeks ago, one of my old friends asked me a SAS trick question, I was glad I can still give her some hints. So, I decide to create a repo at **github** and hope the materials and contents I collected may help anyone in SAS programming, at least, to some extent. 

Back to 2017, I spent a lot time on reading SAS tech white papers. I also spent quite a few time to refactor legacy codes both from my work and my personal toolkit so that it becomes more readable and shorter.

While I was learning, I took some personal notes as well. 

## Key notes  
The Key notes are listed below.

* [Sas code efficiency notes](https://github.com/zhangou888/OZ_SAS_notes/blob/main/efficiency/SAS_coding_efficiency_notes_OZ.pdf)

* [Sas Macro notes](https://github.com/zhangou888/OZ_SAS_notes/blob/main/macro/SAS_Macro_Notes.docx)


# Repo structure

The repo [OZ SAS notes](https://github.com/zhangou888/OZ_SAS_notes) contains 8 sub-folders:

The repo covers all the SAS tech paper I've learned. Hope these materials could give you some help.
